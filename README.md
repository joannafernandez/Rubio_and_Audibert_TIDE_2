Code repository for TIDE data analysis and representation from paper: DNA damage at Lamina Associated Domains triggers nuclear envelope reorganisation and chromatin detachment to prevent nuclear envelope blebbing and genome instability

Code to generate Sup. Fig 2 panel is called "sup_fig_2.py". To run code, supply "/path/to/tideR0_percentages.csv" for variable "R0perc" and supply "/path/to/tideR0_pvals.csv" for variable "R0pval". Figure cleaned up in illustrator.

Code to generate Fig 4.A and 4.B is called "Figure4AandB.py". To run code, supply "/path/to/ATMi_percentages.csv" for variable "atmiperc" and supply "/path/to/ATMi_pvals.csv" for variable "atmipval". Figures were cleaned up in illustrator. To run code, supply "/path/to/siH2AX_percentages.csv" for variable "siperc" and supply "/path/to/siH2AX_pvals.csv" for variable "sipval". Figures were cleaned up in illustrator.
